As part of learning Golang I have implemented two examples of the Perceptron pattern for a neural network.

One is a Perceptron learning f(x) = 2\*x + 1 and another is learning NAND. The NAND example is of course simpler and easier to verify against the WikiPedia page, which shows each iteration and what the values should be.
