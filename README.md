As part of learning Golang I have implemented two examples of the Perceptron pattern for a neural network.

One is a Perceptron learning f(x) = 2\*x + 1 and another is learning NAND. The NAND example is of course simpler and easier to verify against the WikiPedia page, which shows each iteration and what the values should be.

TODO:

* Code a steering perceptron (i.e. a car that avoids certain targets and goes towards others).
* Find an example for a multi-layer neural network to code.
