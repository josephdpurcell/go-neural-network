As part of learning Golang I have implemented three examples of the Perceptron pattern for a neural network. These were all inspired by Daniel Shiffman's "The Nature of Code" book.

The simplest is a Perceptron that learns NAND. This is easy to verify the iterations against the WikiPedia page.

Slightly more complex is the example of a Perceptron learning f(x) = 2\*x + 1. This example is interesting to see how the learning constant affects accuracy and speed of learning.

Lastly, is an example of a Perceptron learning how to "drive". I don't understand this example so ignore it for now.

TODO:

* Find an example for a multi-layer neural network to code.
